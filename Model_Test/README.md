Make a new API key put it in a .env API_KEY API_SECRET=-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----\Your API Key\n-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----\n USDC_WALLET_ID

Change the API key ECDSA in the advanced settings. Then pip install requirements.txt Then uncomment the part of the code that gets the wallet information Then to get the Wallet ID run the code and in the terminal you will see your Wallet Id. Then add it to the .env Then go to the total_balance and uncomment the part where I made it equal to 10 so that it can run.
